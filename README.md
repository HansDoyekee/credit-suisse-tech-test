# README

The source code included is my attempt at completing the technical exercise set by **Credit Suisse** in the time recommended by the recruiter: **30 mins.**

# Implementation
For the purpose of this exercise, I have followed the guidelines set and only implemented the `ReceiveTick` method in the `EquityOrder` class.


# Tests

Again, I have focused mainly on writing unit tests for the `ReceiveTick` method, covering all the scenarios described in the guidelines.
